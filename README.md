## Abstract

*XXX.*

## Replication

We provide all the functions needed to replicate our workflow in the "functions" folder.

#### Generated data

The "dataset" folder contains the data produced in this study. 

* XXX

* XXX

### Functions

The "functions" folder contains all the custom functions coded for the analysis.
They are all sourced from the `.R`, `.pdf` and `.Rmd` files and therefore the 
user of the code does not need to source them separately.

### Code

We offer the code in `.R`, `.pdf` and `.Rmd`. There are three main analyses:

* `code_synthetic_example`:

* `code_uncertainty_analysis`:

* `code_hydrological_models`:

Our entire workflow can be run and theresults replicated from either of these files. 
The user must run the code from the same folder where the files in the generated data 
section are stored for a successful compilation.
